# Required readings

For this week please read:

* an old [piece](http://www.jstor.org/stable/420315) by [Jonathan Nagler](http://politics.as.nyu.edu/object/JonathanNagler) providing some very useful advice on coding as related to ETL and data analysis. Still incredibly good advice that I follow to this day. You can read a recent summary blog post [here](https://blog.oup.com/2015/02/jonathan-nagler-writing-good-code/) updating that piece.


# Additional resources

A lot of knowledge has been accumulated over the last years and codified in coding style rules by the RStudio folks:

* for a book-version, you may want to read [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)'s book chapters on [R coding](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html) and [style](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html), from his [R Packages book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz)

* or you may want to go directly to the [`tidyverse` style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org) that contains best practices followed by all developers working on the `tidyverse`. (The guide itself is an evolution from the older [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) )

* if you haven't already, check out the [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package for code analysis in R.


# Complementary readings

A few resources that may serve you in the future:

* [The Practice of Programming](http://www.informit.com/store/practice-of-programming-9780201615869), per Jonathan's recommendation read the Preface, Chapters 1, 3, 5, 6, and the Epilogue
* [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) to better understand object-oriented languages
* [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/020161622X/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=devtools-20) with general advice on how to be a good programmer/coder
