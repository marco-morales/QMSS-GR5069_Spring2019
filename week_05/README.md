Today we have a guest lecture to talk about Applied Data Science from the perspective of Data Engineering. While seldom part of aspiring Data Scientists' curricula, it is one of the most important collaborations in practice. A Data Scientist that understands the perspective and can talk the language of Data Engineering from the get-go is a very effective Data Scientist from day one.
