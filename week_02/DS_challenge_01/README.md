# DS CHALLENGE 1 - (the First Ring of the Replication Inferno)

This is a typical academic replication file in the social sciences. In general it takes the form of an "if you know what I'm doing, you should be able to figure out what I did" project. That is seldom the most amicable approach to the "future you" (who has already forgotten the details of this project) or to anyone else who wants to jump and build off of your work.  

The best way to understand the shortcomings of this approach - and the usefulness of DS best practices - is to live the frustration of attempting to use it.

It's not atypical - as a Data Scientist - to jump midway on a project, take over from someone else, or be asked to resurrect some old project and continue iterating on it. It should be a straightforward thing to do if the project contains sufficient *structure*, *documentation* and *commented code*.

**Instructions**: take a look at the [`replication_materials`](/replication_materials/). The `DC_1.pdf` file contains some basic descriptions of this project and a table of outputs. Your task is to try to replicate the outputs in the paper running their code in the `DC_1.R` file. The purpose of the challenge is not to replicate the outputs. You have to do it, but let's be honest: you could run the code blindfolded! It is about understanding what the author of the code was trying to do, why was it done the way it was done, and the steps that could have been taken to simplify the life of someone who is trying to replicate this project (that is, you in this case).

**Deliverables:**
Use an R markdown (`Rmd`) notebook to document each step of your replication. We want to see the code and its outputs your notes explaining what you think was done at each step, and suggestions of what could have been done to make your life easier. From this notebook, create a markdown (`.md`) file and push it to the GitHub classroom assignment repo. The file should contain:
* the results from your replication - the code you ran and the outputs [30%],
* your own detailed annotations of the difficulties you faced at each step to replicate [30%], and
* your suggestions on how to improve these materials so it becomes easy for someone else to replicate [40%]

Follow the instructions on GitHub Classroom to submit your assignment. Please make sure to submit it **no later than 6PM on the day of our Week 3 class**. Be prepared to discuss in class your roamings through the First Ring of the Replication Inferno. A rich sharing will make for a richer Week 3 lecture.
