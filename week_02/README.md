# Required readings

Data Science remains a very nebulous concept with a very fluid definition, perhaps for the best. While there is no agreed upon definition, we must talk a bit about it. For this week you should read:

* this
[piece](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf) by David Donoho discussing data science (and statistics). An incredibly relevant piece for Social Scientists to read as they head into the world of
Data Science.
* take also a few minutes to read Drew Conway's [original post](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) on the Data Science Venn Diagram ...and since this is week 2, keep going on this [compilation](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/10/battle-data-science-venn-diagrams.html) of iterations on the same idea
* an old classic post [A taxonomy of Data Science](http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/) (2010) from people coming from the hard sciences
* a nice [article](https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists) by Hugo Bowne-Anderson on what Data Scientists really do
* a conversation with Hillary Mason on the [Past, Present and Future of Data Science](https://soundcloud.com/dataframed/1-data-science-past-present-and-future) from the [DataFramed podcast](https://soundcloud.com/dataframed)

This week we will also be discussing a few topics related to best practices in contemporary data science. A few additional resources below.

## Complementary readings

Buzzwords are commonplace in Data Science these days, and each Data Scientist will probably have a different interpretation for each of them. That makes it a perfect recipe for confusion. But, you can start with some readings to get the general gist of them:
* this [piece](https://medium.com/agile-in-learning/the-psychology-of-agile-87f92521a5ed) summarizes the benefits that people perceive from the **Agile** way,  
* this other [piece](https://medium.com/@jakek/stop-brainstorming-and-start-sprinting-16180839b43d) about what a **sprint** is, how it works, and why it's useful. And also [this one](https://medium.com/agile-in-learning/from-agile-to-fragile-how-to-unravel-your-team-in-one-sprint-5e60e70a557) on how and where sprints can go wrong,
* yet another [piece](https://hackernoon.com/mvp-paradox-and-what-most-founders-need-to-be-aware-of-3a5f8c3acb76) on how to think about minimum viable products (**MVPs**)
