# QMSS G5069 -  TOPICS IN APPLIED DATA SCIENCE FOR SOCIAL SCIENTISTS

[Marco Morales](mailto:marco.morales@columbia.edu), Columbia University

This repository is a companion to the course __Topics in Applied Data
Science for Social Scientists__ taught at the
[Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences](http://qmss.columbia.edu/)
program over the Spring of 2019.

It contains references, slides, code, and starter files for
data science challenges. You can find the most updated version of the course
syllabus [here](/syllabus/GR5069_Spring2019.pdf), and some useful resources on the [wiki](/wiki/). Make sure to check them regularly.


## Overview

In his now classic [Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram),
[Drew Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Conway) described **Data Science** as sitting at
the intersection between **good hacking skills**, **math
  and statistics knowledge**, and **substantive expertise**. As a
result of normal instruction, social scientists possess a fluid
combination of all three but also bring an additional layer to the
mix. We have acquired slightly different training, skills and expertise tailored to understand human behavior, and to _explain why things happen
the way they do_. __Social scientists are, thus, a
particular kind of data scientist__.

This course is a collection of topics that fill very specific gaps
identified over the years on what a social scientist
should know at minimum when entering data science, and what a data
scientist should know to hit the ground running and add immediate
value to their teams. To do that, this course aims to:
* sharpen you technical skills not only in **fitting models**, but
  particularly in **building knowledge and generating insights** from the
  data. While this may seem obvious for a Data Scientist, it is not
  always the focus of training,
* train in **working effectively in teams** to build projects and
  products. Data Science is collaborative in nature and constantly
  evolving in **best practices** that enhance efficient
  collaboration. Collaboration for school projects/assignments is vastly different from the **highly-structured collaboration** that happens in DS teams,
  but is not always the focus of training,,
* learn processes and practices at the **intersection of Data
  Science and Data Engineering** that are central to the **data product
  cycle**. Data Scientists typically start being exposed to Data Engineering on the job. There's much to be gained from early exposure to concepts and practices in this field; and
* sharpen and enhance **soft skills** that are key to a
  successful interaction with business stakeholders. The most
  important - and often neglected - activity
  of a data scientist is to obtain expert knowledge from and
  communicate with non-technical audiences. The greatest
  insight/project/product is moot if no one outside the Data Science
  team understands it or its value.

  All of these are highly valued skills in the data science job market,
  but not always considered explicitly as part of an integral Data
  Science curriculum.

## Prerequisites:

It is assumed that students have basic to intermediate knowledge of [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/),
including experience using it for data manipulation, visualizations,
and model estimation. Some mathematics, statistics and
algebra will also be assumed.

There are no required textbooks for this course, but you might find
these to be very useful resources for the course and later in your
careers:

## To actively participate on this course

By the second session, make sure to have the latest versions of
[__R__](https://www.r-project.org/), [__RStudio__](https://www.rstudio.com/), and
[__Git__](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer. Also, make sure to have registered
for a [__GitHub__](https://github.com) account. [__Atom__](https://atom.io/) is also recommended to simplify your interaction with Git and GitHub.


### Accessing course materials

You have two options to access the materials on this repository:

1. **Dynamic:** Clone the repository by clicking on the on the  "Open
    in Desktop" button. If you do not have a git
    client installed on your system, you will need to
    [get one here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui) and also to make
    sure that [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  This
    is perhaps best, since you can refresh your clone as new content gets
    pushed.

3. **Static:** download the entire repository as a zip file  by
    clicking on the on the  "Download ZIP" button. Note that
    you will have to download it again every time it is updated (and
    it will be updated at least weekly during the semester).

You can also subscribe to the repository. This will send you updates
each time new changes are pushed to the repository.
