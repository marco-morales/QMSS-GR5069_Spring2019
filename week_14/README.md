## Required readings

This reading will provide breadth and depth for this week:

* a path-breaking [piece](http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/stable/25791835?pq-origsite=summon&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) by [Brambor](http://thomas.brambor.com/), [Clark](https://pols.tamu.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/william-r-clark-charles-puryear-professor-of-liberal-arts/) and [Golder](http://mattgolder.com/) on interactions. It's undoubtedly one of the least understood tools in statistical analyses, despite being the bread and butter to address the types of questions that social scientists typically ask

## Complementary readings

Other approaches have been suggested to assess the effects of deep interactions through ML models:
* a foundational [piece](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1273584455) by Chipman et al. to understand Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) which we'll be using to model understand interactions from a ML perspective
* an interesting [piece](https://www.surveypractice.org/article/2716-using-lasso-to-model-interactions-and-nonlinearities-in-survey-data) by [Signorino](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/psc/signorino/) and Kirchner suggesting the use of LASSO to model interactions


There is a number of resources that delve deep into interactions and interactive effects:
* a site created by Matt Golder, for all things [Interactions](http://mattgolder.com/interactions)
* Kam and Franzese's [book](https://www.press.umich.edu/206871/modeling_and_interpreting_interactive_hypotheses_in_regression_analysis)
* Bill Greene's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Econometric-Analysis-7th-William-Greene/dp/0131395386)
