# Before this week's class begins

You should have installed both [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/) in your computer. If you haven't already go ahead and get them here:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)


# Suggested materials

Git and GitHub have done a great job of putting together and facilitating resources to make it easy to use them (once you've understood them). They are not entirely intuitive at first, so you may want to start with some of these resources, and immediately get to play around with them.

## git

* [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) which is a perfect intro to Git
* [visualizing git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) to help you visualize what happens at each step of using Git
* [Git Cheatsheets](https://services.github.com/on-demand/resources/cheatsheets/) put together by the GitHub team
* [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book if you're getting really serious about Git

## GitHub

* the GitHub YouTube channel [GitHub training series](https://www.youtube.com/GitHub)
* [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com) hands-on tutorials put together by GitHub
* [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is a 5-minute tutorial to understand the basics of team collaboration through GitHub 
* [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/) is a great place to start at the source

## Atom

Although it's probably best to start with the command line, once you're comfortable coding in a text editor, it might start to make sense to also interact with git and GitHub from your text editor as well. Atom is an open source text editor - supported by GitHub - with a nice integration with git and GitHub (aka an IDE).

* the [Version Control in Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/version-control-in-atom/) and [GitHub package](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/github-package/) chapters from the [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io) to understand the basics of working with git and GitHub from Atom
* [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io) if you want to learn more about other packages that will make it easier to code in your language of choice
* [a quick video overview of Atom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5POoGSrtGg)

## Integration with RStudio

It's also quite simple to integrate Git and GitHub with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), you can read more in
* [Chapter 13](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) of [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)
* [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/) from the folks at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
