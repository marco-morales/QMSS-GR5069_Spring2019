munge_data <- function(baseEventData, StateNames, ForcesTable, SourceString){

    # ::::::::: DESCRIPTION
    #
    # The function performs the following transformations in the data to
    # produce the desired output data:
    #
    # 1. add actual names of states and municipalities from a Census table;
    #    currently the database only has their numeric codes
    # 2. rename columns from Spanish to English (not everyone speaks both languages)
    # 3. convert UNIX timestamp variable to a time object; this will be useful to
    #    seamlessly create a date variable, and extract month names for graphing
    # 4. some additional string changes in state abbreviations that will be useful
    #    when graphing
    # 5. adding a new variable that indicates the armed force involved in the
    #    confrontation event
    # 6. replace all missing values with 0; this will come in handy as we start to
    #    explore the data further
    #
    # ::::: INPUTS
    #
    # i)   BaseEventData - the raw database to be munged
    # ii)  StatesName - a table with State/Municipality names
    # iii) ForcesTable - a table that identifies which armed forces were involved in the event
    # iv)  SourceString  - a string that will identify origin of the table
    #
    #:::::: OUTPUT
    #
    # the function returns a dataframe

    #
    # The function munges table that contains the armed forces participating
    # on each event, and needs to be merged with their actual names. Since
    # certain events have more that one armed force participating, further
    # wrangling needs to happen to produce a single row per event and not
    # losing information, hence that information is placed in additional
    # columns.
    #
    # 1. add actual names of armed forces from a manually input table gathered from
    #    data documentation
    # 2. converts a variable containing the names of armed forces into columns
    # 3. remove duplicate records where more than one armed force participated in
    #    the event
    # 4. keep only needed variables
