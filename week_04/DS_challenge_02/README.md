# DS CHALLENGE 2 - (a Guided Tour of Portability and Replicability)

You have a well-structured project here. One problem, though. The last person working on it "forgot" to update the current script in GitHub with the latest additions that allowed it to run smoothly with R 3.5.2.

You'll need to spend some time debugging and updating the code to be able to generate the data. The project is structured and the code is commented so you should have an easy time updating it.

**Deliverable:**
Create a new branch `update-code-branch` where you:
* correct the code so that
    * it can be run in R 3.5.2 ("Eggshell Igloo"), and add **comments** that start with your initials explaining what you did (e.g. `# [MM] changed the function here to include ...`) [20%]
	* commit **logical atomic groups of changes** with informative messages [20%]
* add a markdown (`md`) file that:
    * embeds the 4 graphs generated in the `Graph_ViolenceData_170223.R` file, with a brief explanation of what each of the graphs is showing [20%], and
    * contains a data summary using the `summary()` function, and detailing the differences with the summary provided in the repo [20%]
* merge the branch back to the `master` branch [20%]

Please make sure to submit it **no later than 6PM on the day of our Week 5 class**.
