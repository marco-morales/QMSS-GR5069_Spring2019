### R

If you are taking this course, you are not new to R. But if you need a handy refresher, make sure to revisit some of these resources:

* [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)
* [R Code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com/)
* [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) with great resources to learn more R and [DataCamp Community](https://www.datacamp.com/community) with lots of interesting posts relevant to keep up to date

Even if you're not new to R, you may have started to encounter things you simply cannot understand. Do not despair, there is a way out of the [_The R Inferno_](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf). If you want to delve deeper into the structure of R to leverage it better with your coding, make sure to consult the first few chapters of [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)

### Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a very common communication tool in the DS world, especially appreciated for its ability to integrate with a number of tools and applications.

Although it is pretty intuitive to use, but it never hurts to browse their [Getting Started](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768) and [New Members](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members) pages.

Slack works on Markdown, so you may want to check out some [gimmicks](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages) to format your messages.

You may also want to explore [one](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054413/know-it-all/everything-you-are-afraid-to-ask-about-slack-etiquette) or [two](https://gist.github.com/chandracarney/f3c3e62bdeff75826d07) pieces commenting on Slack etiquette.
