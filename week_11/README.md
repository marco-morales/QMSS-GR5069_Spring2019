## Required Readings

* a [piece](http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ss/1294167961) by [Galit Shmueli](http://www.galitshmueli.com) going deep on the differences between modeling for explanation vs prediction which are not often spelled out with pristine clarity. A very interesting discussion - both philosophical and empirical - of these differences.

## Complementary readings

These three readings synthesize much of the current state of the art on what we know about prediction/forecasting in the context of time-series forecasting, primarily, but with advice relevant to prediction tasks generically:

* a [piece](https://repository.upenn.edu/marketing_papers/146/?utm_source=repository.upenn.edu%2Fmarketing_papers%2F146&utm_medium=PDF&utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages) by J. Scott Armstrong providing steps and principles to evaluate forecasts based on dense stack of academic research.
* another [piece](https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1190&context=marketing_papers) by Armstrong on the empirical differences between fitting models and generating predictions/forecasts
* make sure to skim through this [piece](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296315001459) by Armstrong and colleagues compiling principles that summarize current knowledge on forecasting
