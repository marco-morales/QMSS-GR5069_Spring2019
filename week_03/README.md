Data Science projects must fulfill three aims, to be useful for collaboration:

* **replicability**
* **portability**
* **scalability**

This week we'll discuss some principles - and tricks - that take your projects to that level. To prepare the discussion, you may want to skim through some of the links below to get a sense of how people have implemented DS projects and the structures they have though behind their proposed structures.

### Creating DS project structures

People have put thought into standardizing project creation practices in Data Science, to the point of automating the creation of projects in ways that are generic and flexible enough to encompass multiple use cases. Two very useful ones are [Cookiecutter for Data Science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) tailored for Python, and [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html) developed for R. 

While you may or may not want to use them to create your projects, they are certainly a rich source of food for thought on what needs to be considered when creating a Data Science project.

As [Cookiecutter](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#be-conservative-in-changing-the-default-folder-structure) would put it: "be _liberal_ in changing the folders around for your project, but be _conservative_ in changing the default structure for all projects."
