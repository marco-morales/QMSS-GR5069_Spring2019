# Week-10-Workshop
The purpose of this workshop is to demonstrate how Data Engineers and Data Scientist colloborate in a real Enterprise Data Science Project. The goal is to understand how to fork and replicate a data scientists project and move that code base into a funtional data product.

## Step 1 - Connecting to Base Code
1. Create a fork of this repository
2. Connect your forked repository to your RStudio Session
3. Install the following R Packages (fpp2, tidyverse, rjson, RCurl, ggplot2, mongolite)

## Step 2 - Running the Code
1. Change the parameters in the API Query String to your desired output
2. Change the 'model_age' parameter to your desired age for modelling 

## Step 3 - Insert Model Outputs to NoSQL DB
1. Assigned credentials will be provided to each person including user names & password
2. Details will be provided to insert into the script 

## Step 4 - Visualize Model Outputs
1. Steps to Visualize the Model Outputs are in the docs folder
